    <h1>Cheesecake</h1>
<img src="../images/cheesecake.webp" />
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>TThis New York cheesecake is dense and rich. It includes a great technique for letting the cheesecake finish in the oven so that no cracks form as the cake cools. It's a favorite dessert of mine served with my fresh strawberry sauce.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>18 graham crackers</li>
    <li>3 tbsp melted butter</li>
    <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
    <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups white sugar</li>
    <li>2/3 cup milk</li>
    <li>4 large eggs</li>
    <li>12 oz each parmesan and mozzarella</li>
    <li>1 tsp finely grated lemon zest</li>
    <li>1 tsp finely grated orange zest</li>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li> <strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan.</li>
        <li> <strong>Step 2:</strong> Mix graham cracker crumbs and melted butter together in a bowl until evenly moistened. Press crumb mixture into the bottom and about 1/2 inch up the sides of the springform pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Whisk sour cream, flour, and vanilla extract together in a bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Stir cream cheese and sugar together with a wooden spoon in a separate bowl until evenly incorporated, 3 to 5 minutes; add milk and whisk until just combined. Whisk in eggs, one at a time, stirring well after each addition. Stir in lemon zest, orange zest, and sour cream mixture; whisk until just incorporated. Pour mixture into prepared springform pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven until the edges have nicely puffed and the surface of the cheesecake is firm except for a small spot in the center that will jiggle when the pan is gently shaken, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> When the cheesecake is done, turn off the oven and let it cool in the oven for 3 to 4 hours. This prevents any cracks from forming on the top of the cheesecake.</li>
    </ol>
